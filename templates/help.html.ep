<p>Thanks for reaching out.  Caleb has done a fabulous job working on the "storyboarding" of the app itself so that we can see what the app might look like and how one might interact with it.  You can check that out here: http://invis.io/5WS9FB98</p>

<p>Caleb and I have been working on a demonstration app that allows us to actually interact with the server and database as though we are walking around with a phone.  We can control sliders that "set" our proximity to individual beacons and see the information that is configured to be presented for a particular proximity.  In particular look at the Link as that is the content that will be displayed on the phone for the given inputs (proximity).  That demo is here: http://rtc.dev.kit.cm/</p>

<p>One of our next projects is to complete the server API for what information we capture (e.g. tracking and metrics) and what inputs we take in order to have a definition for what information we present to the user (e.g. the stronger the signal the more detailed the information about the object at hand).  The other big task is to fully come to grips with the app behavior and to define a DWIM (Do What I Mean) type system.  The system needs to be smart about alerts and prompts and to not overdo it but also not miss opportunities to present information to the user.  The goal is to minimize a user's interaction with our app -- the less they interact with our app the less they know it's there and the less the user feels bothered.</p>

<p>Things are very much coming along well for us.  We're able to get a lot done without an app developer yet.  The more we can get done now the easier it will be to hire a developer to just implement on a mobile device what we have already created the scope for.  The app developer will be able to just use our API which can also serve as documentation and the app developer will already have the screenshots that will need to be programmed for the app.</p>

<p>Check out the two links and let me know if you have any questions.  Would be happy to chat with you on the phone or in person some time.</p>
